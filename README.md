# Introduction
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are vital for protecting networks from cyberattacks. Traditional IDS methods often lack transparency in their decision-making processes. Our project leverages XAI to make IDS more interpretable and trustworthy. By using LEMNA, we explain how input samples are classified, enhancing the security and transparency of AI models used in IDS.

# Literature Survey
We reviewed several key studies on XAI and IDS, focusing on methods like SHAP, LIME, and decision tree models. Our approach builds on these methods, aiming to provide high-fidelity explanations for deep learning models dedicated to security applications.

# System Design
The system design includes a detailed architecture of the proposed methodology, incorporating mind maps and a comprehensive overview of the LEMNA algorithm. The design ensures flexibility in adjusting the explanation method according to the target deep learning model.

# Implementation
The implementation section covers the technical details of integrating LEMNA with IDS. It includes code snippets, algorithm descriptions, and step-by-step instructions for replicating the results.

# Results and Discussion
This section presents the outcomes of our experiments, demonstrating the effectiveness of LEMNA in providing high-fidelity explanations for various classifiers. We discuss the implications of these results and their potential impact on enhancing IDS security.

# Conclusion and Future Scope
We conclude with a summary of our findings and suggest directions for future research. The integration of XAI with IDS shows promise in improving the transparency and security of AI systems. Future work could explore further enhancements to the LEMNA algorithm and its application to other security-related problems.
